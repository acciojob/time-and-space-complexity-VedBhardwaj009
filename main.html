    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. It is a crucial aspect of algorithm design, ensuring that the solution is efficient for large inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize space usage, often described using Big-O notation, such as O(n).</p>
